            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Welcome to My Journey: A Blend of Poetry, Skills, and Faith</p>
            <p>
                The road ahead is filled with light,<br>
                In circuits and words, I'll find my might.<br>
                With faith in my heart and hope in my mind,<br>
                In learning and poems, my path I'll bind.<br><br>

                Welcome to my blog! I’m excited to share with you my personal journey, where poetry, the skills I’ll gain after completing my studies, and my faith come together. I believe that each of these areas shapes who I am and where I’m headed.<br><br>

                As a second-year student studying Automation and Information Technology, I’m learning more than just technical skills. I’m learning how to innovate, solve problems, and understand the interconnectedness of systems—whether it’s in technology or life. But it’s not just about circuits and codes; my passion for poetry allows me to express the emotions and thoughts that go beyond what words or machines can capture.<br><br>

                For me, the Bible plays a huge part in this journey. I find inspiration in verses like Philippians 4:13: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” This reminds me that while I might face challenges, faith and persistence will carry me through.<br><br>

                Through this blog, I aim to share the intersection of these three passions—poetry, technology, and faith. Join me on this journey, as I write about what I’m learning and how I hope to apply these lessons in the future.

            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Crafting My Future: A Poetic Glimpse into My Skills and Faith</p>
            <p>
                Wires and circuits, dreams unfold,<br>
                Learning the language, new stories told.<br>
                Skills are built with hands and mind,<br>
                A future in progress, where faith is aligned.<br><br>

                As I continue my studies in Automation and Information Technology, I am gaining a variety of skills that are shaping both my personal and professional growth. These skills are not only technical, but they are also teaching me valuable life lessons, all of which align with the biblical principle of diligence and excellence.<br><br>

                One of the key skills I am acquiring is Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which allow me to automate and control machines. Learning how to program PLCs helps me understand the importance of systems thinking, where each part of a system needs to work together to achieve a larger goal. This is something I can also apply to life—each action and decision should work towards a meaningful and greater purpose.<br><br>

                Another area where I am growing is AutoCAD Design. By learning how to create technical drawings, I’m developing attention to detail and precision, skills that are invaluable whether I’m designing systems or tackling real-life problems. AutoCAD not only sharpens my technical ability but also teaches me the importance of clear communication through visuals.<br><br>

                In addition to these technical skills, I am also learning networking fundamentals and digital electronics, which are vital for understanding how information flows in modern technology. These subjects are expanding my problem-solving abilities and helping me think critically about the impact of technology on everyday life.<br><br>

                Beyond the technical, I find inspiration in the Bible and in verses like Proverbs 22:29: “Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings.” This verse resonates with me as it reminds me that skill is not just about technical expertise but also about how that expertise can be used to serve others and contribute meaningfully to society.<br><br>

                As I develop these skills, I am reminded that learning is a lifelong journey, one that requires not only knowledge but also faith and dedication. My aim is to use what I am learning to make a positive impact, not just in the world of automation, but in everything I do.
